## mypy compatibility

`logoru-mypy` should be compatible with `mypy>=0.770`.
Currently there is no limit as far as the compatibility can go. If you are interested to see
how far `loguru_mypy` goes you can visit [CI/CD action](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) and check its
matrix.

## Installation

Simply execute:

```sh
pip install loguru-mypy
```

And later on modify your `mypy.ini` configuration file with

```ini
[mypy]
plugins = loguru_mypy
```

That is all, your code is now ready to be linted.

## What is included?

`loguru-mypy` is obviously a [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) plugin that allows to avoid
some of those little _runtime_ trickeries :).
Here is a short attempt to list some of those:

### Lazy loggers

`logger.opt(lazy=True)` in facts returns a `logger` that we call _lazy_. Lazy loggers accept only
`typing.Callable[[], t.Any]` in place of positional or named arguments. Passing a callable that
accepts even a **single** argument thus results in runtime error. `loguru-mypy` detects that fact
and lets you know before your runtime reaches that portion of a code.
